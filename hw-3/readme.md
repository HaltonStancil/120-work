# HW-3 Response

This week was rather fun for me. In learning how to execute simple sketches in p5, I discovered some of the possibilities for creation. I experimented with creaing multiple shapes and text areas. I was surprised how easy it was to change things like the color of a background, or draw a shape. Not nearly as much math as I had initially thought there was going to be. Some of the initial difficulties I had was reorganizing my file structure. It was a bit of a challenge trying to follow some of the lessons and lectures with some of my folders out of place. The next difficulty I had was with the GitHub library's display of my repo. I believe that some of the syntax had changed in terms of how the individual files were displayed, so I had to experiment with the extensions in the URL in order to find the file. In terms of things that I would like to discover, I'm interested to see how we can draw more complex/more organic shapes outside of simple figures. I'm very curious to see how the next few weeks will play out, as this appears to be a fun avenue to learn code.
