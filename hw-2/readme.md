In this week, I learned how to use markdown syntax inside of text editors. In creating repositories on my personal computer, I had decided to structure the assignments by week, with iterations in their own specific folder. In following the instructions on the website, I decided to use the Atom editor, and GitHub desktop. In the initial creation of the directories, I had some confusion about where some of my files were saving. I solved it by scrapping the old directories and creating a new one with the required folder hierarchy inside of them. The issue was not big enough for me to seek help from the issues board. In experimenting with some of the markdown language, I was curious as to how many of a particular command you could execute on any given piece of text before something **"bad"** were to occur. Just a thought, though.

- Ok, this is pretty neat
- I've never experimented with something like this before
- This seems **U N U S U A L L Y  A P P L I C A B L E**
